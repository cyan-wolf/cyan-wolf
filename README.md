## About
Hello! I am developer that likes working on personal-projects. I've worked with many different programming languages and technologies, such as Python, Java, C#, C++, 
JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, Rust, Haskell, Godot, Unity, and more. I enjoy learning about different programming paradigms such as imperative, object 
oriented, and functional. I also like math.
